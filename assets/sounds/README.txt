Sound Files for Glitch Runner
============================

To add sound to your game, place the following audio files in this directory:

1. background.mp3 - Background music for the game
2. jump.wav - Sound effect for player jumping
3. land.wav - Sound effect for player landing
4. glitch.wav - Sound effect for when a glitch activates
5. level_complete.wav - Sound effect for completing a level
6. game_over.wav - Sound effect for game over

If these files are not present, the game will run without sound or will generate simple placeholder sounds.
