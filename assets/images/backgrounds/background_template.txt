Background Design Templates for Glitch Runner
======================================

Each level should have its own unique background that matches the theme and difficulty.
Below are design specifications for each level background:

Level 1 - "First Glitches" (level1_bg.png)
-----------------------------------------
Dimensions: 800x600 pixels
Base Color: RGB(30, 30, 50) - Dark blue/purple

Design Elements:
- Simple grid pattern (20x20 pixel grid)
- Subtle circuit-like lines running horizontally and vertically
- A few scattered "glitch" pixels in random locations
- Faint glow effect in the center of the screen
- Low contrast to keep focus on gameplay elements

Layer Structure:
1. Base color background
2. Grid pattern (10% opacity)
3. Circuit lines (15% opacity)
4. Glitch pixels (30% opacity)
5. Center glow (20% opacity, radial gradient)

Level 2 - "Glitch Intensifies" (level2_bg.png)
--------------------------------------------
Dimensions: 800x600 pixels
Base Color: RGB(40, 20, 60) - Deep purple

Design Elements:
- Distorted grid pattern (wavy lines instead of straight)
- Digital noise scattered throughout (like TV static)
- Binary code sequences (0s and 1s) fading in and out
- Occasional horizontal scan lines
- Medium contrast with some brighter elements

Layer Structure:
1. Base color background
2. Distorted grid (20% opacity)
3. Digital noise pattern (15% opacity)
4. Binary code elements (25% opacity)
5. Scan lines (10% opacity, animated if possible)

Level 3 - "Glitch Nightmare" (level3_bg.png)
------------------------------------------
Dimensions: 800x600 pixels
Base Color: RGB(60, 10, 30) - Dark red/burgundy

Design Elements:
- Heavily corrupted grid pattern (broken and glitched)
- Intense digital artifacts and distortion
- Error message fragments and corrupted text
- Glitch blocks and tears in the "digital fabric"
- High contrast with bright flashes and dark areas

Layer Structure:
1. Base color background
2. Corrupted grid (30% opacity)
3. Digital artifacts (40% opacity)
4. Error messages and text (35% opacity)
5. Glitch blocks (50% opacity)
6. Bright flash elements (25% opacity)

Implementation Notes:
-------------------
To use these backgrounds in the game, you'll need to:

1. Create the background images following these templates
2. Modify the Level class to load the appropriate background image
3. Draw the background before other game elements

Example code for loading backgrounds:
```python
self.background = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('assets', 'images', 'backgrounds', f'level{level_num}_bg.png')).convert()
```

Example code for drawing backgrounds:
```python
def draw(self, screen):
    # Draw background
    screen.blit(self.background, (0, 0))
    
    # Draw other elements
    self.platforms.draw(screen)
    # etc...
```
